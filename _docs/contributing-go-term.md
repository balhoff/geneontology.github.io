# Contributing to the Ontology

We strive to make the GO as complete and accurate as possible, so suggestions for new terms and improvements to existing terms are welcome. 

## Suggesting a new GO term

### Before you submit a new term request, check whether the term already exists
To do this, search the ontology using the <a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">AmiGO</a> browser. Note that the term may exist as a primary term name or as a synonym.

###  Gather all necessary information
Please provide suggestions for:

+ New term name
+ Definition
+ Position in the GO hierarchy
+ Literature references (PMID:xxxx, ISBN:xxxx, DOI:xxxx)
+ Term synonyms if appropriate
+ [Cross-references](/docs/download-mappings/) (e.g., KEGG, EC)
+ Synonyms if applicable

For an example, see the entry for [recycling endosome](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055037). Please be specific in your request and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. The ontology editors can more rapidly process requests when all the required information is provided. 
### Communicate with the GO ontology editors

You can use the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a> ([/docs/how-to-submit-requests/](instructions for getting set up with GitHub are here)).
+ Alternatively, you can [contact the GO helpdesk](http://help.geneontology.org/) with your request. 
### Creating a GitHub ticket for a new term request

+ Go to the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a>.
+ Click on the green 'New Issue' button.
+ Enter the subject of your request in the 'Title' field, which will be your queue to find the issue from the list of requests.
+ Enter details of your request in the 'Leave a Comment' box. When requesting a new term for the ontology, please include the following details to the best of your ability:
### Finalizing the ticket submission

+ Press the 'Submit new issue' button at the bottom of the box.
## Suggesting other improvements to the ontology
Common requests to modify terms include: 
+ Missing synonyms or incorrect synonym types
+ Changes to the position of the term in the hierarchy
+ Taxon restrictions
+ etc

Term improvements can be submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a> as dsecribed above. 
## When to create a new ticket
Keep tickets simple; do not hesitate to create multiple tickets if necessary. Unless terms are related, submit a separate request for each new term.
