## GO annotations 

The Gene Association Files (GAFs) containing GO annotations and released by the GO Consortium are shown in the table below. Files are in the GO annotation file format and are compressed using the UNIX gzip utility. Please see the upstream resource information for further details on the annotation set. Any errors or omissions in annotations should be reported by writing to the GO Helpdesk.
Filtered Files

## Filtered Annotation File Downloads
These files are taxon-specific and reflect the work of specific projects, primarily the model organisms database groups, to provide comprehensive, non-redundant annotation files for their organism. All the files in this table have been filtered using the annotation file QC pipeline. A major component to the filtering is the requirement that particular taxon IDs can only be included within the association files provided by specific projects; the current list of authoritative groups and major model organisms can be found below.
