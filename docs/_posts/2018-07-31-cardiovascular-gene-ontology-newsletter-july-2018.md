Our last Cardivascular newsletter
(https://www.ucl.ac.uk/functional-gene-annotation/cardiovascular/newslett...)
provides an infographic

describing the achievements the team has made over the past 10 years.
From now on our quarterly newsletter will provide a summary of the
work acheived by the whole team.
