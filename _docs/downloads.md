# Downloads

The GOC tries to maintain a variety of bioinformatics-ready and
ingest-ready formats for public consumption. If there is something
that you need or think we might be reasonably missing, please feel
free to [contact us](http://help.geneontology.org "contact us"){:target="blank"}.

### Main download sites

Versioned and browsable releases are available at <a href="http://release.geneontology.org">http://release.geneontology.org</a>.
We make new versions available approximately every month.

# Did we not decide NOT to put these links in public sites ?  
The site <a href="http://current.geneontology.org">http://current.geneontology.org</a> is always the last official release made available at <a href="http://release.geneontology.org">http://release.geneontology.org</a>.

We will soon add more documentation about the structure of these repositories.

### DOI versioned bundles

We also offer a complete archive of each release, with DOI, at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1343652">Zenodo</a>.

For users interested in a smaller or more flexible DOI versioned bundles, we offer holey (reference) BDBag at <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1343128">Zenodo</a>.

These bundles are released in step with the above monthly releases.
