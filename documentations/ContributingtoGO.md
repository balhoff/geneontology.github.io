# Contributing to GO 
Research groups may contribute to the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) by providing suggestions for updating the ontology (e.g. requesting new terms) or by providing GO annotations.

## How to contribute GO annotations

If your research group has GO annotations for a species that is not currently included in the GO, whether or not these annotations cover the entire genome, or if your research team has identified gaps or inaccuracies in the current set of GO annotations, this guide is for you. Choose the scenario that best describes your research group and follow the steps as indicated in the following pages.
