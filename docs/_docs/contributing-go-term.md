# Contributing to the Ontology

When you have suggestions for new ontology terms, first make sure the term doesn't exist, either as a primary term or a synonym term. To do this, search the ontology using the AmiGO browser. Requests for new synonyms or clarification of textual definitions are also welcomed.
