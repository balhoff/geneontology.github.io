# [Cardiovascular Gene Annotation Initiative](http://geneontology.org/external-project/cardiovascular-gene-annotation-initiative)

The overall objective of the [Cardiovascular Gene Annotation Initiative](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/functional-gene-annotation/cardiovascular){:target="_blank"} is to provide a unique public resource for the cardiovascular community, both in the UK and internationally, by providing comprehensive functional annotation for genes implicated in heart development and cardiovascular processes and disease.
Active project: 
yes


# [Monarch Initiative](http://geneontology.org/external-project/monarch-initiative)
The [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/){:target="_blank"} aims to provide easy-to-use tools to navigate this data landscape, services for other resources, and educational outreach regarding the production of structured data for biomedical discovery.
Active project: 
yes


# [MoonLight Database Project](http://geneontology.org/external-project/moonlight-database-project)

This is a collaboration between GOC and the MoonLight Database Project. The Moon Lighting protein database curates moonlighting functions of several proteins. These secondary functions are going to be GO curated and added to the corpora of GO annotations.
Active project: 
yes


# [Parkinson’s UK Gene Ontology Project](http://geneontology.org/external-project/parkinson%E2%80%99s-uk-gene-ontology-project)

The overall objective of the [Parkinson’s UK Gene Ontology Project](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/functional-gene-annotation/neurological){:target="_blank"} is to provide a unique public resource for the Parkinson's research community, both in the UK and internationally, by providing comprehensive functional annotation for genes implicated in neurological and immunological processes relevant to Parkinson's disease.
Active project: 
yes


# [Reference Genome Annotation Project](http://geneontology.org/external-project/reference-genome-annotation-project)

The [Reference Genome Annotation Project](http://geneontology.org/page/reference-genome-annotation-project){:target="_blank"} aimed to completely annotate twelve reference genomes, producing a resource that may effectively seed automatic annotation efforts of other genomes.
Active project: 
yes


# [Renal Annotation](http://geneontology.org/external-project/renal-annotation)

The [Renal Gene Ontology Annotation Initiative](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/kidney){:target="_blank"} aimed to provide a unique public resource for renal research by generating high-quality, detailed functional GO annotation for mammalian gene products implicated in renal development and disease, improving annotation and ontology content for the renal system.
Active project: 
yes
