# Contributing to the Ontology

We strive to make GO as complete and accurate as possible, so suggestions for new terms and improvements to existing terms are welcome. 

## Suggesting a new GO term

### 1. Check whether the term already exists
Before you submit a new term request, confirm that the term is not already in the ontology. To do this, search the ontology using the <a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">AmiGO</a> browser. Note that the term may exist as a primary term name or as a synonym.

### 2. Gather as much necessary information as possible
Please provide suggestions for:

+ New term name (required)
+ Definition (required)
+ Position in the GO hierarchy or the parent class (required)
+ Literature references (PMID:xxxx, ISBN:xxxx, DOI:xxxx) (required)
+ Synonyms
+ [Cross-references](/docs/download-mappings/) (e.g., KEGG, EC)

For an example, see the entry for [recycling endosome](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055037). 

+ The ontology editors can process requests more rapidly when all the required information is provided. 

### 3. Communicate with the GO ontology editors
* The easiest way is to contact the [GO helpdesk](http://help.geneontology.org/) with your request. 
* We encourage users to create tickets in the [GO-ontology tracking system](https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues). This allows you to monitor the progress on work on the issue, and participate in the discussion among GO annotation team members. Instructions about how to create an account and use the GitHub repository can be found [here](/docs/how-to-submit-requests/). 

### Creating a GitHub ticket for a new term request

+ Go to the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a>.
+ Click on the green 'New Issue' button.
+ Enter the subject of your request in the 'Title' field, which will be your queue to find the issue from the list of requests.
+ Enter details of your request in the 'Leave a Comment' box. When requesting a new term for the ontology, please include all information (see 'Gather all necessary information' section above). 
+ Press the 'Submit new issue' button at the bottom of the box.


## Suggesting other improvements to the ontology
Common requests to modify terms include: 
+ Adding synonyms or or changing synonym types
+ Changing the position of the term in the GO hierarchy
+ Providing taxonomical restrictions for making annotations to the term
+ etc

Term improvements can be submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a> as described above. 

## When to create a new ticket
Keep tickets simple; do not hesitate to create multiple tickets if necessary. Unless terms are related, submit a separate request for each new term.
