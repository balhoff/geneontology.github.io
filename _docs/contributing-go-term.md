# Contributing to the Ontology

If you have suggestions for new ontology terms, first make sure the term doesn't exist, either as a primary term or a synonym term. To do this, search the ontology using the AmiGO browser. Requests for new synonyms or clarification of textual definitions are also welcomed.


## Suggesting a new GO term:

1. **Before you submit a new term request, please check to see if the term already exists:** Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term already exists, either as a primary term or a synonym. To do this, search the ontology using the <a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">AmiGO</a> browser. 

2. **Gather all necessary information:** Please always provide suggestions for a name, definition, position in hierarchy, references (e.g. PMIDs), [cross-references](/docs/download-mappings/) (e.g., KEGG, EC), and synonyms, if applicable.  The ontology editors can more easily process term requests when all of this information is provided.  For an example, please see the entry for [recycling endosome](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055037). Please be specific in your request and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. 

3. **Communicate with the GO ontology editors**
+ You can use the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a> ([/docs/how-to-submit-requests/](instructions for cgetting set up with GitHub are here)).
+ Alternatively, you can [contact the GO helpdesk](http://help.geneontology.org/) with your request. 

4. **Creating a GitHub ticket for a new term request**
-  Go to the <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology GitHub tracker</a>.
 - Click on the green 'New Issue' button.
 - Enter the subject of your request in the 'Title' field, which will be your queue to find the issue from the list of requests.
 - Enter details of your request in the 'Leave a Comment' box. When requesting a new term for the ontology, please include the following details to the best of your ability:
+ New term name
+ Definition
+ Position in the GO hierarchy
+ Literature references (PMID:xxxx, ISBN:xxxx, DOI:xxxx)
+ Term synonyms if appropriate

5. **Submiting the ticket**
Press the 'Submit new issue' button at the bottom of the box.

## Other term requests: 
Common requests to modify terms include: 
+ Missing synonyms or incorrect synonym types
+ Changes to the position of the term in the hierarchy
 + Taxon restrictions

## When to create a new ticket
Keep tickets simple; do not hesitate to create multiple tickets if necessary. Unless terms are related, submit a separate request for each new term.
