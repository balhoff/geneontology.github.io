# Contributing GO Annotations
While most GO annotations are produced by members of the [GO Consortium](/docs/go-consortium/), we welcome feedback as well as annotations from the research community. 

## Suggesting revisions for existing annotations
Researchers who notice either missing or inaccurate annotations for a gene or a GO term can send this information to the GO ontology consortium.

###  1. Gather all necessary information
- Paper citation (PMID if available)
- A description of the issue: the gene product and the term combination that you suggest be reviewed, and why you believe this is incorrect.
- A suggestion for a solution, if possible. 

### 2. Communicate with the GO annotation team
* The easiest way is to contact the [GO helpdesk](http://help.geneontology.org/) with your request. 
* We encourage users to create tickets in the [GO-annotation tracking system](https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues). This allows you to monitor the progress on work on the issue, and participate in the discussion among GO annotation team members. Instructions about how to create an account and use the GitHub repository can  be found [here](/docs/how-to-submit-requests/). 

### 3. Creating a GitHub ticket
+ Go to the [GOC GitHub Annotation Tracker](https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues){:target="blank"}.
+ Click on the green 'New Issue' button.
+ Enter the subject of your request in the 'Title' field, which will be your queue to find the issue from the list of requests.
+ Enter details of your request in the 'Leave a Comment' box (see 'Gather all necessary information' section above). 
+ Press the 'Submit new issue' button at the bottom of the box.


## Contributing new GO annotations
Research groups who wish to generate GO annotations, for instance new annotations for genes of a species that is not currently annotated in  GO, annotating specific genes for a given biological research domain, can contribute these annotations to the GO database.
