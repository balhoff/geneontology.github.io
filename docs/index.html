      <p>
	Due to the staggering complexity of biological systems
	and the ever-increasing size of datasets to analyze,
	biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent
	on knowledge stored in computable form. The Gene
	Ontology (GO) project provides the most comprehensive
	resource currently available for computable knowledge
	regarding the functions of genes and gene products.
      </p>

      <p>
	The GO knowledgebase is composed of two primary components:

      <h3 class="text-center">Ontology</h3>
      <p>
	The ontology provides the logical structure of the biological
	functions (‘terms’) and their relationships to one another,
	manifested as a directed graph of terms and relations.

	The corpus of GO annotations, evidence-based statements
	relating a specific gene product (a protein, non-coding RNA,
	or macromolecular complex, which we refer to hereafter as
	‘genes’ for simplicity) to a specific ontology term

	Together, the ontology and annotations aim to describe a
	comprehensive model of biological systems. Currently,
	the GO knowledgebase includes experimental findings from
	almost 140 000 published papers, represented as over 600
	000 experimentally-supported GO annotations. These
	provide the core dataset for additional inference of
	over 6 million functional annotations for a diverse set
	of organisms spanning the tree of life.
      </p>

      <p>
	In addition to this core knowledgebase, GO resources
	also include software to edit and perform logical
	reasoning over the ontologies, web access to the
	ontology and annotations, and analytical tools that use
	the GO knowledgebase to support biomedical research.
