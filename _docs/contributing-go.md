# Contributing GO Annotations
While most GO annotations are produced by members of the [GO Consortium](/docs/go-consortium/), we welcome feedback as well as annotations from the research community. 

## Suggesting revisions for existing annotations
Researchers who notice either missing or inaccurate annotations for a gene or a GO term can send this information to the GO ontology consortium.

###  Gather all necessary information
- Paper citation (PMID if available)
- A description of the issue
- A suggestion for a solution, if possible. 
 * Write a new issue on the [GOC GitHub Annotation Tracker](https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues){:target="blank"} to request that our curators review each gene or protein. Include:

### Communicate with the GO ontology editors
You can use the [GO-annotation GitHub tracker](https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues). Information about how to create an account and use the GitHub repository can  be found [here](/docs/how-to-submit-requests/). Alternatively, you can [contact the GO helpdesk](http://help.geneontology.org/) with your request. 

### Creating a GitHub ticket
+ Go to the [GOC GitHub Annotation Tracker](https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation/issues){:target="blank"}.
+ Click on the green 'New Issue' button.
+ Enter the subject of your request in the 'Title' field, which will be your queue to find the issue from the list of requests.
+ Enter details of your request in the 'Leave a Comment' box (see 'Gather all necessary information' section above). 
+ Press the 'Submit new issue' button at the bottom of the box.


## Contributing new GO annotations
Research groups who wish to generate GO annotations, for instance new annotations for genes of a species that is not currently annotated in  GO, annotating specific genes for a given biological research domain, can contribute these annotations to the GO database.
