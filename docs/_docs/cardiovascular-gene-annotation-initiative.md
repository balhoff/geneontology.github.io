The overall objective of the [Cardiovascular Gene Annotation Initiative](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/functional-gene-annotation/cardiovascular) is to provide a unique public resource for the cardiovascular community, both in the UK and internationally, by providing comprehensive functional annotation for genes implicated in heart development and cardiovascular processes and disease. High-throughput genomics and systems biology are particularly powerful tools for the investigation of multi-factorial phenotypes, such as cardiovascular disease. However, at the moment, systems biology approaches to dissect the human cardiovascular system are severely hampered by the lack of functional annotation of many of the key gene products likely to be involved. Consequently this initiative will support a concentrated effort to improve the manual annotation of gene products (proteins and microRNAs) involved in the cardiovascular system using the Gene Ontology and through the capture of protein-protein interactions.

The improved annotation of these genes will ensure that the investment in genome sequencing along with the accumulated knowledge of heart disease and cardiovascular processes can be exploited to the full, for the benefit of researchers seeking to alleviate cardiovascular diseases.

The Cardiovascular Gene Annotation Initiative is a collaborative project between the UniProt and IntAct groups at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Cardiovascular Genetics research group at University College London (UCL) and the Vascular Proteomics group at King's College, London. The annotations created as part of this project are listed with the 'source' BHF-UCL (British Heart Foundation - University College London).
