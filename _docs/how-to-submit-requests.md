# How to Submit Requests for Ontology and Annotations
GO uses <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> as a mechanism for tracking ontology and annotation issues.
+ The <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues">GO-ontology tracker</a> captures suggestions for changes to the ontology, inclusing suggestions for new terms, changes to definitions or term position in the hierarchy, to addition of new subsets. 
+ The <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/go-annotation">GO-annotation tracker</a> is used to report incorrect annotations or to make suggestions for new annotations. 
 
## Creating a GitHub account

+ On the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub website</a>, press the 'Sign up for GitHub' button at the top-right corner and follow  the instructions. Once registered, sign in using button in the upper right-hand corner. 
+ By signing up for a GitHub account, you can track your submissions online and via email. This tracker is visible to anyone (but only people with GitHub accounts can add issues and comments). 
+ Note that the volume of messages on these repositories are significant; we recomment that you set your notifications to 'Not watching' using the button with the 'eye' icon, found at the upper right corner of the page, so that you will only get notified of tickets you have created or in which you have been mentioned. If you choose to 'Watch' a repository, an email will be sent every time comments are added to the issue, or when its status changes.

## Submitting a new ticket to GO via GitHub

+ Visit the appropriate GO ontology requests tracker. Click on the green 'New issue' button in the top right corner.

More details about contributing to the ontology are available in the [GitHub Guidelines for Contributing Ontology tickets](https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target="_blank"}. A brief description is included below.
 

### Suggesting a new GO term:

1. **Before you submit a new term request, please check to see if the term already exists:** Before submitting suggestions for new ontology terms, check whether the term already exists, either as a primary term or a synonym. To do this, search the ontology using the <a href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo">AmiGO</a> browser. 

2. **Provide all necessary information:** Please always provide suggestions for a name, definition, position in hierarchy, references (e.g. PMIDs), [cross-references](/docs/download-mappings/) (e.g., KEGG, EC), and synonyms, if applicable.  The ontology editors can more easily process term requests when all of this information is provided.  For an example, please see the entry for [recycling endosome](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055037). Please be specific in your request and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. 

3. **Create the ticket**
 - Click on the green 'New Issue' button.
 - Enter the subject of your request in the 'Title' field, which will be your queue to find the issue from the list of requests.
 - Enter details of your request in the 'Leave a Comment' box. When requesting a new term for the ontology, please include the following details to the best of your ability:
+ New term name
+ Suggested definition
+ Suggestion about where it should appear in the GO hierarchy
+ Pertinent literature references (PMID:xxxx, ISBN:xxxx, DOI:xxxx)
+ Any possible synonyms of the new term
- Press the 'Submit new issue' button at the bottom of the box.

+ Unless terms are related, submit a separate request for each new term.

### Other term requests: 
Common requests to modify terms include: 
+ Missing synonyms or incorrect synonym types
+ Changes to the position of the term in the hierarchy
 + Taxon restrictions

 
## Keeping track of your requests
To find your request again in the GOC tracker, while on the page listing all submitted issues, use the 'Filters' box and drop-down menu to restrict the types of request you may display.
